# Last Ember - Open Source

In this repository are the parts of the game Last Ember that I created myself. This includes the C# scripts, and a few placeholder sprites. Everything else is too tied up to release as open source.

This game was written in C# for Unity 2018.3.0f2.

I've included a build of the game that shows off almost everything created so far.

You can run by double-tapping a direction, jump, wall jump, look up and crouch. There were going to be other moves, but we didn't get around to implementing them.
